        Noqui is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
        flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
        and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, 
        olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally 
        in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
